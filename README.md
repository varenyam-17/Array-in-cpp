# Array-in-cpp
## Aim:
To study and implement C++ arrays and strings.
## Functions Used:
- Declaration: type arrayName[array_size];
- Initialization: int arr[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
- Input/Output: cin >> arr[i];, cout << arr[i];
- Reversal: Looping from end to start and storing in another array.
- Search: Loop through array to compare and count.
- Sum & Average: Iterative summing and division.
- Max & Min: Comparison-based traversal.
## Theory:
### Arrays
- Fixed-size collection of elements of the same type.
- Stored in contiguous memory, indexed starting from 0.
- Elements are accessed using indices within square brackets.
- Memory addresses of elements increase sequentially (e.g., int type increases by 4 bytes).
  ### Strings:
  - C++ string is a class providing built-in functions.
- Different from character arrays (char[]), which are simpler and lack inbuilt manipulation tools.
### Algorithm:
